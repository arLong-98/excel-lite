# excel-lite 

The project features a simple *grid UI* inspired by **google sheets**.
I started working on this project so as to test my vanilla js, algorithms and problem tackling skills.

Tech Stack
- Javascript
- HTML5
- CSS

## Features ðŸš€
- Implemented a two way binding for grid cells. Created a data layer to represent the grid in memory and binding the ui with the data and vice-versa.
- Apply formulas on cells just like **excel**. 
- Implemented a **graph data structure** to work with *formula* evaluation on cells.
- Implemented a **cycle detection** algorithm for a *directed graph*.
- Implemented a **cycle trace** algorithm so the end user can trace the cause of a cycle in a sheet with multiple formulas.
- Implemented a **sheet management** script that allows us to *add* and *remove* sheets with synchronous storage.
- Download your sheet as a json file or upload a json file and use it as a sheet,
   implemented using **fileReader** webApi.
