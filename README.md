# excel-lite

The project features a simple grid UI inspired by google sheets.
I started working on this project so as to test my vanilla js, algorithms and problem tackling skills.

## Features
- Implemented a two way binding for grid cells. Created a data layer to represent the grid in memory and binding the ui with the data and vice-versa.
- We can apply formulas on cells just like excel.
- Implemented a graph data structure to maintain formula evaluation on cells.
- Implemented a cycle detection algorithm for a directed graph.
- Implemented a cycle trace algorithms so the end user can trace the cause of in a sheet with multiple formulas.
- Implemented a sheet management script that allows us to create and remove sheets.
